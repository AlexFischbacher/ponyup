## Note: This is not yet intended for actual use!

## TODO
- Re-enable yesterday's version tests
- Select default toolchain, rather than symlinking immediately on update
- Release static binaries for initial install
- Test Non-Linux platforms

## Usage

### Installing Nightly Pony

The following command will download the latest nightly release of Ponyc and install it to `~/.pony/ponyup/bin` by default.

```bash
ponyup update nightly
```
